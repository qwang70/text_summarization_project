B00374ZKQ0,review covers stevia raw product packet form tried bulk product great alternative sweetener leaves taste detect use tea cereal three different kinds oatmeal everything used tasted sugar used cam accross couple articles stevia browsing internet reading two articles little research decided try stevia found product local kroger store happened sale kroger carries two three stevia based products however comparing list ingredients decided buy stevia raw list ingredients packet form product dextrose stevia extract tired tastes great everyhting used curious stevia extract supposed times intensely sweet sugar case dextrose used prevalent ingredient called company asked question answer dextrose carbohydrate derived crushed corn filler product rebiana intensely sweet impractical package pure form individual packets volume would small consumers would wonder anything really sounds plausible dietician doctor work company simply use product like hope info helpful everyone gret day first ties truvia fact decided replace truvia recently stevia raw typing grocery store stevia raw cheaper would always felt truvia expensive personally believe phrase get pay since sometimes consumer paying marketing expensive product case true like sugar raw buy way better regular sugar bleached processed bone char first raw would mean pure stevia also contains dextrose dextrose cheap additive sweet made corn high carb great finished tough workout need carbs great call stevia rawhaving formerly worked food chemical sales know dextrose glucose artificial additive however diabetes caused high levels glucose blood therefore find quite scary labeled raw diabetics may use someone wishing avoid sugar would use granted truvia fruit sweetener well stevia actually sweet would hardly anything pack otherwise takes little stevia sweeten something calling raw either let bypass take sugar stevia packs move rest huh get packs stevia raw box get packs truvia box superb huh likely stevia raw tiny bit less expensive think woo hoo get less marketing dogs saw coming mile away fast kept making coffee hating taste bitter began adding packs stevia raw still sweet bought new coffee thinking must stronger something found pack truvia drawer realized much pack simply picking pack added one pack coffee tasted finally sweet got thinking stevia raw box look net weight packets ounces shopping pick box truvia packets ounces woa use stevia raw packets equal taste one truvia packet next nothing inside packet suspected gave packets less inside one waste paper time opening packet packet one cup joe quite frankly like deceptive marketing going every ounce box stevia raw wait one thing stevia raw sugar glucose form really calories amount low amount one packet time use many calories may snuck calories add care calories calories comparing two products little packet stevia raw would surprise truvia way erythritol one best natural zero calorie sweeteners buy brand sweet erythritol great diabetics dieters one spike blood sugar still natural stevia lightweight needs counterpart erythritol stevia cousin dextrose cheap filler certain product sold place could find review wanted review somewhere love stuff tried major stevia brands stevia raw brand taste like crap brands heavy bitter licorice aftertaste stevia raw unique put powder tongue without grimacing cannot even normal sweeteners like nutrasweet equal suppose somewhat sensitive palate heavy amounts sweetener use still detect slight aftertaste even stevia raw heavy user sensitive palate combine erythritol good aftertaste whatsoever combo way better sweetener mostly drink english tea yummy english tea pretty good green tea herbal teas well pros odorit sweetnot poweringno licorice like flavorno tastezero caloriesgluten freecons obviously sugar pretty good tried years years like stevia always left funky aftertaste mouth ruined use tolerable stevias vanilla cream sweetleaf even left funky taste months ago decided marathon stevia taste test adventure bought almost every brand give high expectations fully expected leave funky taste truvia another added sweetener pure stevia tested pure stevia plain flavor vanilla flavor shocked beyond belief using stevia raw funky taste tried many different ways chai tea sweeten hot breakfast cereal baking cooking sweet treats etc aftertaste also tried larger quantities sometimes use increased taste far matter done stevia aftertaste ever tried like stevia cannot get past taste give stevia raw think surprised pleased yay finally stevia like bought shoprite happy enjoy sweet things compared sweetners truvia purvia like product support coca cola pepsi buy also two ingredients dextrose stevia extract pack gram assume maybe gram dextrose sugar fda allows labeling serving calories called zero calories understanding dextrose needed bulking agent online searching shown dextrose contains cal per gram use many packets tea coffee calories free packets made water lemon juice taste like real cup lemonade made real sugar would like calories taste much better healthier splenda guess taste buds completely different considering mixed reviews product thought stevia raw pretty good
